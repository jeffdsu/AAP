##Day 1
    Things I think == console logs
    what I want show == what people using the gui sees ( I want to make it look like the real bay max)
    brain is on the cloud
    Gui is what I look like and this is what I look like http://www.toysrus.com/graphics/product_images/pTRU1-18073608enh-z6.jpg.
    If we build this I think the automation team gets a giant Bay-Max in their area.  Also maybe an model bay-max at each desk.
    
    
    So automation engineers will come and ask bay max 
    
    User: hey! I need help to test this feature. Can you tell the cloud to populate this seedData so I can get on with my new tests of the cloud?
    
    bay-max will reply : ok! no problem! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC49uRsKmR8
    
    So now I am the best friend of Lady Cloud and you the automation engineer.
    
    I'm tired.  I will go to bed now.

##Day 2

    DB is memory
    So when a new ENV is coming up, AAP will run through its memory and populate the new ENV with the data it needs
